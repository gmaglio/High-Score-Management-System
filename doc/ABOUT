HSMS - High Score Managment System

Goal 1:  

     Implement GUI that allows user to insert record into HIGH_SCORES table.  A record is described by the following schema:

		name TEXT
                score INTEGER
                date INTERGER(YYYYMMDD)

     The GUI is to display a text entry field for each DB field (3 fields currently).  A Button is clicked to insert the entered data into the database.  

     The following cases must be handled:
 
                1 - Mismatched datatype (ie. user enters text into numeric field)
                2 - Uniqueness Constraint violated

GUI Spec.
---------

- The Main window primarily renders a listbox that displays the records of the sqlite datebase.  

- A 'menu bar' is included to allow the user to spawn the 'insert box'.  

- The listbox must be refreshed each time a record is inserted via the 'insert box'. A 'refresh' button' should also be available via the 'menu bar' to refresh the 'listbox'.
