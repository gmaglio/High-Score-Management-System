HSMS - High Score Managment System


Description 
------------
This is a proof-of-concept of Record Managment utilizing the following technologies and APIs: Ruby, sqlite3 and gtk2.


Run
----
cd src
./hsms_ui.rb


Goals and Expectation of Functionality
---------------------------------------
Goal 1:  

     Implement GUI that allows user to insert record into HIGH_SCORES table.  A record is described by the following schema:

		name TEXT
                score INTEGER
                date INTERGER(YYYYMMDD)

     The GUI is to display a text entry field for each DB field (3 fields currently).  A Button is clicked to insert the entered data into the database.  

     The following cases must be handled:
 
                1 - Mismatched datatype (ie. user enters text into numeric field)
                2 - Uniqueness Constraint violated
